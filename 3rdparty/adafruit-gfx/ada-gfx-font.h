This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common
set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).  It needs to be
paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry
(to handle the lower-level functions).

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please
support Adafruit & open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!
