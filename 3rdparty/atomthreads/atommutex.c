    \brief Atomthreads mutex library (see \ref ATOM_MUTEX)

    \defgroup ATOM_MUTEX MUTEX
    \ingroup ATOM

 * This module implements a mutual exclusion library with the following
 * features:
 *
 * \par Flexible blocking APIs
 * Threads which wish to take a mutex lock can choose whether to block,
 * block with timeout, or not block if the mutex is already locked by a
 * different thread.
 *
 * \par Interrupt-safe calls
 * Some APIs can be called from interrupt context, but because a mutex
 * must be owned by a particular thread the lock/unlock calls must be
 * performed by threads only (i.e. it does not make sense to allow
 * calls from interrupt context). All APIs are documented with their
 * capability of being called from interrupt context. Any attempt to
 * make a call which cannot be made from interrupt context will be
 * automatically and safely prevented.
 *
 * \par Priority-based queueing
 * Where multiple threads are blocking on a mutex, they are woken in
 * order of the threads' priorities. Where multiple threads of the same
 * priority are blocking, they are woken in FIFO order.
 *
 * \par Recursive locks
 * A mutex can be locked recursively by the same thread up to a
 * maximum recursion level of 255. An internal count of locks is
 * maintained and the mutex is only released when the count reaches
 * zero (when the thread has been unlocked the same number of times
 * as it was locked). This makes a mutex more suitable for use as
 * mutual exclusions than a semaphore with initial count of 1.
 *
 * \par Thread ownership
 * Once a thread has locked a mutex, only that thread may release the
 * lock. This is another feature which makes the mutex more suitable
 * for mutual exclusion than a semaphore with initial count 1. It
 * prevents programming errors whereby the wrong thread is used to
 * perform the unlock. This cannot be done for semaphores which do not
 * have a concept of ownership (because it must be possible to use them
 * to signal between threads). 
 *
 * \par Smart mutex deletion
 * Where a mutex is deleted while threads are blocking on it, all blocking
 * threads are woken and returned a status code to indicate the reason for
 * being woken.
 *
 *
 * \n <b> Usage instructions: </b> \n
 *
 * All mutex objects must be initialised before use by calling
 * atomMutexCreate(). Once initialised atomMutexGet() and atomMutexPut()
 * are used to lock and unlock the mutex respectively. A mutex may be
 * locked recursively by the same thread, allowing for simplified code
 * structure.
 *
 * While a thread owns the lock on a mutex, no other thread can take the lock.
 * These other threads will block until the mutex is released by the current
 * owner (unless the calling parameters request no blocking, in which case the
 * lock request will return with an error). If a mutex is released while
 * threads are blocking on it, the highest priority thread is woken. Where
 * multiple threads of the same priority are blocking, they are woken in the
 * order in which the threads started blocking. 
 *
 * A mutex which is no longer required can be deleted using atomMutexDelete().
 * This function automatically wakes up any threads which are waiting on the
 * deleted mutex.
