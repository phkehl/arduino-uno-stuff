/**
 * \b thread_shell
 *
 * Shell routine which is used to call all thread entry points.
 *
 * This routine is called whenever a new thread is starting, and is
 * responsible for taking the entry point parameter off the TCB
 * and passing this into the thread entry point, as well as enabling
 * interrupts. This is an optional function for a port, as it is
 * also possible to do this with a regular context restore if the
 * appropriate registers are saved for context switches (parameter
 * and interrupt enable). Alternatively a flag could be used to
 * notify archFirstThreadRestore() and archContextSwitch()
 * that they should this time restore the contents of the parameter
 * registers and enable interrupts. After restoring a thread first
 * time the context restore routines need not perform those
 * operations again. This is discussed in more detail below.
 *
 * When starting new threads, ports must pass in the entry point
 * function parameter, and enable interrupts. This can be handled by
 * the first context restore for new threads if they are saved as
 * part of the thread's context. However for the AVR port we have
 * chosen to save only the minimum registers required for context
 * switches. This reduces the cycle time required for all context
 * switches during operation. This means, however, that we don't save
 * the parameter registers R25/R24 or the SREG. These would otherwise
 * be used when restoring a thread for the first time to pass the
 * parameter to the entry point, and enabling interrupts in the SREG.
 *
 * A few of the possible ways round this are to:
 *
 * a) Save R25/R24 and SREG with the normal context - thus increasing
 *    the processor cycles required on each context switch.
 * b) Use a thread shell routine which is used to start all threads.
 *    This routine can then pass the parameter and enable interrupts,
 *    without incurring any overhead on all context switches.
 * c) Store a flag in a new thread's TCB to notify the normal context
 *    switch routine that it must (the first time a thread is restored
 *    only) pass the parameter, and enable interrupts.
 *
 * We have chosen to implement (b) in this case, as it does not affect
 * normal context switch times just for the benefit of the first restore,
 * and it does not incur extra complication to the thread restore
 * routines through handling special cases. A thread shell is also handy
 * for providing port users with a place to do any initialisation that
 * must be done for each thread (e.g. opening stdio files etc).
 *
 * Other ports are free to implement whatever scheme they wish. In
 * particular if you save all necessary registers on a context switch
 * then you need not worry about any special requirements for
 * starting threads for the first time.

/**
 * \b archThreadContextInit
 *
 * Architecture-specific thread context initialisation routine.
 *
 * This function must set up a thread's context ready for restoring
 * and running the thread via archFirstThreadRestore() or
 * archContextSwitch().
 *
 * The layout required to fill the correct register values is
 * described in archContextSwitch(). Note that not all registers
 * are restored by archContextSwitch() and archFirstThreadRestore()
 * as this port takes advantage of the fact that not all registers
 * must be stored by gcc-avr C subroutines. This means that we don't
 * provide start values for those registers, as they are "don't cares".
 *
 * Because we don't actually save the parameter registers (R25-R24)
 * for this particular architecture, we use a separate thread shell.
 * The thread shell is always used as the thread entry point stored
 * in the thread context, and it does the actual calling of the
 * proper thread entry point, passing the thread entry parameter.
 * This allows us to pass the entry parameter without actually
 * storing it on the stack (the thread shell routine takes the
 * entry point and parameter from the thread's TCB). On other ports
 * you may instead choose to store the entry point and parameter
 * in the thread context and use no thread shell routine.
 *
 * Similarly we use the thread shell in this case to enable interrupts.
 * When a thread is restored and started for the first time, it must
 * also enable interrupts. This might be done by setting up the
 * appropriate value in the SREG register for enabled interrupts, which
 * would then be restored when the thread is first started. But to
 * reduce register-saves we do not save SREG on the AVR port, and
 * instead we use the thread shell routine to enable interrupts the
 * first time a thread is started.
