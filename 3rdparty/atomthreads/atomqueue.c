    \brief Atomthreads queue library (see \ref ATOM_QUEUE)

    \defgroup ATOM_QUEUE QUEUE
    \ingroup ATOM

 * This module implements a queue / message-passing library with the following
 * features:
 *
 * \par Flexible blocking APIs
 * Threads which wish to make a call which may block can choose whether to
 * block, block with timeout, or not block and return a relevent status
 * code.
 *
 * \par Interrupt-safe calls
 * All APIs can be called from interrupt context. Any calls which could
 * potentially block have optional parameters to prevent blocking if you
 * wish to call them from interrupt context. Any attempt to make a call
 * which would block from interrupt context will be automatically and
 * safely prevented.
 *
 * \par Priority-based queueing
 * Where multiple threads are blocking on a queue, they are woken in order of
 * the threads' priorities. Where multiple threads of the same priority are
 * blocking, they are woken in FIFO order.
 *
 * \par Configurable queue sizes
 * Queues can be created with any sized message, and any number of stored
 * messages.
 *
 * \par Smart queue deletion
 * Where a queue is deleted while threads are blocking on it, all blocking
 * threads are woken and returned a status code to indicate the reason for
 * being woken.
 *
 *
 * \n <b> Usage instructions: </b> \n
 *
 * All queue objects must be initialised before use by calling
 * atomQueueCreate(). Once initialised atomQueueGet() and atomQueuePut() are
 * used to send and receive messages via the queue respectively.
 *
 * Messages can be added to a queue by calling atomQueuePut(). If the queue is
 * full the caller will block until space becomes available (by a message
 * being removed from the queue). Optionally a non-blocking call can be made
 * in which case the call will return with a status code indicating that the
 * queue is full. This allows messages to be posted from interrupt handlers
 * or threads which you do not wish to block, providing it is not fatal that
 * the call could fail if the queue was full.
 *
 * Messages can be received from the queue by calling atomQueueGet(). This
 * will return the first message available in the queue in FIFO order. If
 * the queue is empty then the call will block. Optionally, a non-blocking
 * call can be made in which case the call will return with a status code
 * indicating that the queue is full. This allows messages to be received
 * by interrupt handlers or threads which you do not wish to block.
 * 
 * A queue which is no longer required can be deleted using atomQueueDelete().
 * This function automatically wakes up any threads which are waiting on the
 * deleted queue.
