    \brief Atomthreads semaphore library (see \ref ATOM_SEM)

    \defgroup ATOM_SEM SEM
    \ingroup ATOM

 * This module implements a counting semaphore library with the following
 * features:
 *
 * \par Flexible blocking APIs
 * Threads which wish to decrement a semaphore can choose whether to block,
 * block with timeout, or not block if the semaphore has reached zero.
 *
 * \par Interrupt-safe calls
 * All APIs can be called from interrupt context. Any calls which could
 * potentially block have optional parameters to prevent blocking if you
 * wish to call them from interrupt context. Any attempt to make a call
 * which would block from interrupt context will be automatically and
 * safely prevented.
 *
 * \par Priority-based queueing
 * Where multiple threads are blocking on a semaphore, they are woken in
 * order of the threads' priorities. Where multiple threads of the same
 * priority are blocking, they are woken in FIFO order.
 *
 * \par Count up to 255
 * Semaphore counts can be initialised and incremented up to a maximum of 255.
 *
 * \par Smart semaphore deletion
 * Where a semaphore is deleted while threads are blocking on it, all blocking
 * threads are woken and returned a status code to indicate the reason for
 * being woken.
 *
 *
 * \n <b> Usage instructions: </b> \n
 *
 * All semaphore objects must be initialised before use by calling
 * atomSemCreate(). Once initialised atomSemGet() and atomSemPut() are used to
 * decrement and increment the semaphore count respectively.
 *
 * If a semaphore count reaches zero, further calls to atomSemGet() will block
 * the calling thread (unless the calling parameters request no blocking). If
 * a call is made to atomSemPut() while threads are blocking on a zero-count
 * semaphore, the highest priority thread is woken. Where multiple threads of
 * the same priority are blocking, they are woken in the order in which the
 * threads started blocking. 
 *
 * A semaphore which is no longer required can be deleted using
 * atomSemDelete(). This function automatically wakes up any threads which are
 * waiting on the deleted semaphore.
 *
 *
 * \n <b> Notes: </b> \n
 *
 * Note that those considering using a semaphore initialised to 1 for mutual
 * exclusion purposes may wish to investigate the mutex library available in
 * Atomthreads.
